# California_house_price_prediction
In this project I used California census data from the StatLib repository to build a model of housing prices in the state.This dataset contains 20640 instances and 10 attributes.


**These features are:**
* Longitude
* Latitude
* Housing Median Age
* Total Rooms
* Total Bedrooms
* Population
* Households
* Median Income
* Median House Value
* Ocean Proximity

This is a typical **supervised learning** task, and also a **univariate regression** problem, since we are only trying to predict a single value (Median House Value) for each district.

## Overview
The main steps I went through:
- Get the data
- Discover and visualize the data to gain insights
- Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms
- Select a model and train it
- Fine-tune your model
